# Realease 2
In this release we have updated the sceleton we created in release 1 to be a modular application, dividing it into the Core and the UI modules. We have also moved the project below the root gitlab folder to make it more tidy. We have written av few more tests, scaled back on functionality it turned out we didn't need (such as the application beeing able to write to several different diaries) and overall made several small fixes. In addition, we wrote this PlantUML diagram, to clealy illustrate how the application functions:
