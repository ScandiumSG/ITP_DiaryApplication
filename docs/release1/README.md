## Intro 

For this release is the first draft, or skeleton if you like, for a maven/javaFX build project created. As well as the basic generation of the project is some FXML files added and a few simple tests. The group has collected common goals and intentions with this course and defined these in a contract. As a group are we ready for a challenge of this calibre greatly ambitious. 

<br/>

## Project description

The DiaryApp class starts the application based on Diary.FXML as interface. The FXML-document refers further to DiaryController to collect defined logics. DiaryController converts inputs from the user to an Entry-object. The Entry-class will then, with help from EntryToJSON, write to a JSON-file. The user may also load earlier content from another JSON-file. EntryFromJSON is the reason this is possible. 

<br/>

## Work habits
As the project still is in an early stage is there not too much code related tasks to do. We do however have to weekly meeting to plan and structure for future task coming up. We also did do lots of pare programming to make sure every member is well aware of what the final product should look like as well as get to know the code itself.
