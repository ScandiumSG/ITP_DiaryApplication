        As the product related to the visible user interface doesnâ€™t change between release 1 and 2 both user histories are identical. Therefore, the group decided to create a single file for both release 1 and 2.

-   As an imaginative and thoughtful person, I find it necessary to collect my thoughts somewhere. That's why I need some place where I may write down my thoughts to look back at them in the future. That's why I would like a diary capable of storing my thoughts over extended periods of time, with the option to view and edit them later.

</br>

-   I would like to choose different dates to read content from the past. If I'm wondering what I did on a particular date, I would like the ability to check the diary. Therefore it is important to me that my dairy offers a feature to select dates instead of page number.

</br>

-   I have traditionally used pen and paper diaries, which makes it difficult to edit previous entries. Therefore I would like to try a diary application that would allow me to easily change previous entries. I like to create multiple drafts before submitting my entry, and would therefore prefer the application to not auto-save my drafts.
