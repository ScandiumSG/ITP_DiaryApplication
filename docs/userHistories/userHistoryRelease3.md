-   As a user who shares my computer with other family members I would like to make sure I’m the only one able to access my dear diary. Therefore, I prefer to have login interface that requires authorization to access my diary. A pin code would be preferable.

-   I would like a quick and straightforward method of moving between days in my diary. Sometimes I'd like to read yesterdays diary entry, or plan out tomorrows activities. In those cases it would be lovely to be able to navigate where I want with a single click.

-   I'm a very active person and sometimes I have very little time to fill in my diary. In those cases I benefit greatly from being able to make a outline of the diary entry beforehand. Therefore I would like to be able to plan my future diary pages.
