## Digitalisation of Diaries

As a long time diary author have I faced many challenges by writing down all my thoughts, feelings and keeping track of my life. By only imagining how many paper pages I have spent my money on do I see both financially and environmental issues related to the fact. I have lost countless of diaries, which caused me losing track of parts of my life, good memories, and important lessons. My little brother has managed to figure a method to unlock my diaries with the tip of a pencil. He loved to read them and make fun. By switching to an application, offering a digital subsidy of regular diaries have all my problems vanished. The diary app will never be written out as it offers countless of pages. I’m not afraid of typos or regression of what I wrote as I simply may delete and rewrite all content, whenever I like so.

<br/>

## Keep It a Secret

My family share a computer located in the living room. This means I must write the diary on this computer. As none of the family members have any computer skills does none of them know how to look at file structures and find my diary pages. They do however know how to open an application. To me it’s important that the new diary have a login screen that only I may access with a pin-code. By having a pin all my sleepless nights are gone as I know my whole family can not realistically access my diary.

<br/>

## Structure Dates of Content

I sometimes think about what I did the same day one month ago but can’t remember. Therefore, I like the feature where I have the availability to lookup the exact date that I am thinking about, to read what I wrote. As I am writing every day a page describing my day should surely appear. If the page is blank, it means I haven’t started to use the diary app yet. This I am planning to fix by filling in all pages for earlier date than when I installed my digital diary.

<br/>

## Write for the Future

As my daily schedule is filled up am I usually in a hurry. Even though my days seem to be busy am I writing down my experiences and though every day. Somedays, however, are busier which is why I like to fill in bullet points, layouts, even expectations for upcoming dates I know some of the content of. This makes my life easier and the typing more effective.

<br/>

## Edit and Move Daily

Sometimes I feel like editing or update something I wrote in the past. By selecting the date, I want to be able to add additional content for the day. I may also delete regrettable comments or rewrite them. A few times I want to rewrite something I wrote just a day ago. In these cases, I would appreciate a quick and straightforward to navigate a day at a time.

<br/>

## Double fun

As I experience a lot during my weeks, during work hours, at school, when I am with friends, and home with my family, it would be convenient to have multiple diaries. One for my professional life and one for my personal life.
I would like these diaries to be connected to a single user, so I would not have to remember additional pin codes. This would allow me to write about my days at work and school, as well as one for my personal thoughts about my friends and family.
