Greetings!

<br/>
Welcome to the project of group 2172 Fall 2021. 

<br/>
<br/>

We are glad to see you
<br/>
We have created a diary for the user. <br/>
By typing your name you may personlize the book for your own use. 
By entring gr2172/src/main/java may two classes be found. One entry class and one diary class. The entry is for the user to define themself by endtring their name. <br/>
The diary class is the diary logics.
